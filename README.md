#PRIME - Object Activity

###The purpose of this activity is to practice creating, manipulating, and using objects in JavaScript.

#####I am not a sports fan, so I chose to create a model based on my friend's favorite team, Real Madrid.
#####I do not know if the information is completely correct, but I hope the object will be used correctly.
